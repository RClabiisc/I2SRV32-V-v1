Issues discussed: #362,#354,#382, 

The following issues were discussed.

#362,#354,#382 Fractional LMUL additional registers

There was considerable discussion trying to understand the design of
the scheme to pack multiple fractional LMUL registers into the base
vector registers.  The conclusion was that we first had to understand
how fractional LMUL would map into the base vector registers,
including interaction with SLEN, before attempting to add fractional
LMUL register packing as another optimization with another level of
complexity.

Waiting on receiving the fractional LMUL mapping.

#367 Tail Agnostic

The discussion reviewed the proposal that long temporal vector
registers with renaming could be handled using vector length trimming.

The proposal was then added that masking should also be given option
of being agnostic giving three options:
 1) tail-undisturbed + masking-undisturbed
 2) tail-agnostic + masking-undisturbed
 3) tail-agnostic + masking-agnostic

All implementations would have to support all options.

Simple implementations can ignore setting and treat all as 1).

Option 2) could be implemented as option 1) even if option 3) was
supported.

The recommendation was that agnostic destination elements had to only
be either zero or undisturbed.

Discussion to continue with this suggestion.
