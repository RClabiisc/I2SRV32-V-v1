== Calling Convention

In the RISC-V psABI, the vector registers `v0`-`v31` are all caller-saved.
The `vstart`, `vl`, and `vtype` CSRs are also caller-saved.

The `vxrm` and `vxsat` fields have thread storage duration.

Executing a system call causes `v0`-`v31` to become unspecified.

NOTE: This scheme allows system calls that cause context switches to avoid
saving and later restoring the vector registers.

NOTE: The values that `v0`-`v31` assume after a system call cannot expose
information from other processes, so typically the registers will either
remain intact or will be zeroed.
